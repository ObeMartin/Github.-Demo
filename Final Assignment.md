#github.final assignment

For my final assignment, 
I will make a web-based application which I hope to use as my daily to-do-list.
The end user will be me and my family at the start but if it works better for us, then introducing it to friends won't be a problem.
I hope that this app will have more options like adding new lists of the plans that may come up during the course of the day and mark items that I'm done with or delete them.
